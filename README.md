# Mapping multi-contrast microstructural MRI of the placenta

![](Images/parameter_maps.jpg)

Project to map multi compartment models to MRI scans of a healthy and pre-eclampsia placenta.
These scans varied the b and T2* parameters to allow modelling of the variation of fluid speed
and oxygenation. This is especially helpful with regard to the placenta due to it's multiple
compartments

A number of models were implemented including IVIM, T2*-ADC, Continuum and 3 Compartment

Qualaitive and quantative difference were found between the scans using these models
